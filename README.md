# Testline
The Quiz App is a web-based interactive application designed to engage users in a gamified quiz experience. It dynamically fetches quiz questions from an external API and presents them in a user-friendly interface.

Key Features:
✅ User Authentication: Users enter their name to start the quiz.
✅ Dynamic Questions: Questions with multiple-choice options are fetched from an API.
✅ Timer & Progress Bar: A countdown timer and progress bar enhance the challenge.
✅ Scoring System: Users receive real-time feedback and a final score summary.
✅ Gamification: Features like time limits and a progress bar make the quiz engaging.

Technical Stack:
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (vanilla)
Data Integration: Fetches quiz data via API with error handling
State Management: Uses JavaScript to manage quiz flow and user interactions

Note:The provided API (https://api.jsonserve.com/Uw5CrX) was not returning quiz questions as expected. To ensure smooth functionality and meet the project requirements, I integrated an alternative external API source for fetching quiz data. Please let me know if there are any specific API preferences or adjustments needed.
